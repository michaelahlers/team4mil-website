# Team 4Mil Website

## Purpose

Team 4Mil's needs are simple: an attractive web site, with minimal content management (CMS) features. Everyone in an authoring role has familiarity and access to Facebook, and adding another heavy-weight CMS into the mix would cause confusion. The solution is to use Facebook as the CMS.

## Statement

As Team 4Mil is now defunct, this repository is kept only as a portfolio piece. It represents a few firsts for its author: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), and integration with APIs from Facebook and Google Maps. There are here a few unconventional and less-than-perfect solutions, and—not having been maintained since 2013—many outdated practices. It should therefore not suitable for educational purposes.
